Title: Connect Four

Target Platform: Both desktop and mobile

Game Genre: Abstract strategy

Game's Objective: The primary goal of the player is to be the first to connect four of their own discs of the same color consecutively in a line (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally), before the opponent does.

Rules of the Game:

- Players take turns dropping their colored discs (one player has red, the other has yellow) into any of the columns in the grid.
- The disc will occupy the lowest available space within the column.
- The first player to connect four of their own discs in a line wins.
- If the grid is filled and no player has achieved this, the game is a draw.
- Double Drop is an added special ability to drop two discs in a single player turn.
- Remove Last Disc is an added special ability to remove your opponents last placed disc.

Game Mechanics:

- Players will use their chosen input method (mouse, touchscreen, etc.) to select the column in which they wish to drop their disc.
- After a column is selected, the player's disc will automatically drop to the lowest available space in the chosen column.
- Players can only redeem each special ability (Double Drop, Remove Last Disc) once during a game.
- Players will use their observational and strategic skills to decide the best column to choose on their turn, in order to achieve the game's objective while also blocking their opponent from doing the same.
